## Deploying a React App* to GitHub Pages
    We have followed along with this [link](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages) tutorial - we'll end up with a new React appâ€”hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v20 or higher)
- npm (v10 or higher)

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/selvarasu-k/food-is-medicine.git
    cd food-is-medicine
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4. **Open the application in your browser:**
    ```bash
    local: http://localhost:3000/food-is-medicine
    remote: https://selvarasu-k.github.io/food-is-medicine/
    ```

## Connect with backend API via JSON server

### Steps
1. **Set up the JSON Server:**
    ```bash
    npm install json-server
    ```

2. **Create a db.json file:**
    ```
    Create a file named db.json in your project directory. 
    This file will contain your mock database
    ```

3. **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    json-server --watch db.json --port 5000
    ```

4. **Open the application in your browser (localhost):**
    ```bash
    local: http://localhost:5000/users or articles or roleaccess or others
    ```

5. **Open the application in your browser (remote via onrender.com):**
    
    - **OnRender (Render.com)**: is a cloud platform that provides various hosting and deployment services for web applications, APIs, and other server-side applications.

    - **Automatic Deployments**: Render can automatically deploy your applications whenever you push changes to your Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).

    - **Connect Your Repository**: Connect your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository to Render.

    - **Connect Localhost Server**: Your local development environment can interact with the deployed API by using the provided URL. Update any necessary configuration in your local server to point to the remote API endpoint on Render.

    ```bash
    remote: https://json-server-deployment-uepg.onrender.com/
    ```
